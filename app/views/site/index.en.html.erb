This is an emergency campaign to demand your country's MEPs to act immediately
for the Western Sahara: <%= link_to "By filling this form", message_path %> you
will send automatically an e-mail to your country's representatives in the European Parliament
in your own language.  The aim of this tool is to allow you to reach every MEP
with a unique message written by yourself (i.e. not using "copy&amp;paste").  
Please write in a simple and natural way, and most importantly, do it with 
respect and clarity.  Only this way they'll listen to what you have to say.</p>

<p>Once the form in submitted, your message will be sent to the email addresses
of your country's representatives in the European Parliament.</p>

<p>Besides, you can copy this chunk of
<a href="http://www.sahararights.net/integrate">HTML code</a> and paste it
in your web to integrate the form.  This way, we can be thousands of webs
and blogs calling for this action.</p>

<p>We have created this tool to transmit
by every means the universal demand for justice, dignity and respect for the lives
of those who today are persecuted by professional and paramilitary forces on the
streets of El Aai√∫n.  Together we may, using this tool, cooperate to demand that
the Europarliament protest against these acts.  If they get hundreds of thousands
of mails, they'll have to listen to us.</p>


<p>Proposals to be considered when composing your message:
   <ul>
      <li>Explain briefly with your own words what is happening, tell them how
you feel and what they should do on your behalf.</li>
      <li>Ask them to demand that the Moroccan government to cease using
violence against the Sahrawi population in the Occupied Territories of Western
Sahara.</li>
      <li>Demand that they stand in front of the European Parliament and ask for
it to intervene in the conflict, as well as asking the same of the international
community.</li>
      <li>Ask them to demand the immediate release of illegally detained
Sahrawi; there are hundreds of people reported missing or arrested.</li>
      <li>Tell them in your own words that the UN must take action by enforcing
Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the
resolutions adopted for the non-self-governing Territories of the Sahara.</li>
      <li>Explain to them that they should ask the UN to have the Security
Council grant MINURSO the ability to monitor Humans Rights, reporting directly
to the UN Security Council.</li>
      <li>Remind them that the UN has an obligation to protect the population of
non-self-governing Territories whilst they await a referendum on
self-determination, in accordance with the resolutions of the UN General
Assembly, UN Security Council and the African Union.</li>
      <li>Ask them to raise their voices, to allow civilians to act as human
