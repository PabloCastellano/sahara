<p>On October 10th, over 20,000 sahrawis started a large peaceful protest to reclaim their right to work, not to be discriminated against, and the use of their natural resources, by establishing a camp of 7,000 haimas 15 km away from El Aaiún (Laayoune, capital of Western Sahara).</p>

<p>30 days later, the Moroccan government sent its´ army to assault and destroy the sahrawi camp of Agdaym Iziken. 11 people were killed, 723 were injured and 159 missing, not counting civilians sent to prison, hospitals and military camps.</p>

<p>At the same time, the occupying forces of Morocco have encouraged and armed settlers in the city of El Aaiún, who, together with policemen in plain clothes, broke into houses, businesses, and burnt vehicles of sahrawi citizens. Morocco's army has declared a state of martial law over the Occupied Territories of Western Sahara.</p>

<p>Silence is not an option, and there is no way to stop the fair requests of the sahrawi people. On the other hand, there is an ability to protect those suffering repression. This is the reason we have created this tool; to transmit by any means the universal demand for justice, dignity and respect for the lives of those who today are persecuted by professional and paramilitary forces on the streets of El Aaiún. Together we may, using this tool, cooperate to demand that the Europarliament protest against these acts.</p>
